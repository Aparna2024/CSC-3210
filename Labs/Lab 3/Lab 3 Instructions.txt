Part 3B: Debug the project
Debug the rest of the code one line at a time. 
There is an answer sheet provided with the lab. 
After executing each line record the register value in the answer sheet. 
Then also provide short explanation for the changes. 



Part 3C: Math problems
Problem 1: Suppose a program contains  500 million instructions to execute on a processor running on 2.2 GHz. Half of the instructions takes 3 clock cycles to execute, where rest of the instructions take 10 clock cycle. What is the execution time of the program?

Problem 2: A processor is 20 MIPS. If you run a program on that processor and the program takes 30 seconds to finish. How many instructions are there in this program?
