Lab 5 Instructions

Lab 5A
Create a project and generate listing file 

Write and run a program with following instructions:
  mov 20 to AL register
  mov 100 to AX register
  mov 1000 to EAX register
  add 2 to the content of EAX register
  subtract 20 from al register
Generate listing file for the program


Lab 5B
Write a program to evaluate an expression variables

Write a program to implement the following expression in assembly:
EAX = Xval - (Yval + Zval)
Xval is signed 32-bit integer variable
Yval and Zval are unsigned 32-bit integer variable
Assign Xval 26, Yval 30, and  Zval 40.



Lab 5C
Write a program to see the data items in an array

Use DUP to allocate (create space for) an array or string. 
 Syntax:                            counter DUP ( argument )
 Counter and argument must be constants or constant expressions

var1 BYTE 20 DUP(0)	; 20 bytes, all equal to zero
var2 BYTE 20 DUP(?)	; 20 bytes, uninitialized
var3 BYTE 4 DUP("STACK")   ; 20 bytes: "STACKSTACKSTACKSTACK"
var4 BYTE 10,3 DUP(0),20	; 5 bytes


Lab 5D
Write a program to find the size of the string

; Calculating the size of the String
.386
.model flat, stdcall
.stack 4096
ExitProcess proto, dwExitCode:dword
.data
myString byte "This is a very long string made by your instructor to test how $ works in this lab hope you will like it"
myString_length = ($ - myString)
.code
main proc
	mov eax,0
	mov al, myString_length
　
invoke ExitProcess,0
main endp
end main
